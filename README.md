# system
A WordPress theme for my personal website. The goals of this theme is to be as fast and clean as possible. The name system comes from the font stack that was inspired by Medium. It uses the default system font from the the operating system you are viewing the website from.

## Getting started
This theme uses gulp to process front end assets. Preprocessing is based on Jake Cobleys work https://github.com/JakeCobley/gulpfile.js.

To start working:

1. `CD` to directory of the theme.
2. Run `npm install`. This can take a few minutes.
3. Run one of the following commands `npm run watch` or `npm run build` to begin watching or building the files.

## Demo

## Support and questions
This theme is for my personal site. I am trying to make it as generic as possible so anyone can use it. If you have any questions feel free to contact me. https://daveredfern.com/contact/
